# GraphQL Performance Monitoring Proxy

This repo is for students to inspect, clone, open issues or questions or follow up on updates to the proxy server for my blog post: [How to make your own GraphQL metrics dashboard](http://all-loops-considered.org/2018/05/09/graphql-metrics-part-1/)

This is a proxy server for a GraphQL API which has the Apollo Tracing enabled in order to collect those performance metrics and relay the query response to the client. Please see my blog post above for more information.
